This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Details

1. Created to accompany my resume.
2. Next.js used in order to eventually leverage the static / server rendering offered by the development framework
3. Data is currently static included in each .tsx file, will eventually be moved to JSON document storage (most likely CouchDB or MongoDB) 
4. Chakra UI used due to pre-made components and to simplify theming across the website
