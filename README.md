This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Project Details

1. Created to accompany my resume.
2. Next.js used in order to eventually leverage the static / server rendering offered by the development framework
3. Data is currently static included in each .tsx file
4. Chakra UI used due to pre-made components and to simplify theming across the website

## Updates in Progress / Ideas for Future
1. Move static data to JSON document storage (most likely CouchDB or MongoDB)
2. Rework `Personal Projects` Section to it's own screen with live code examples
3. Create footer with direct links to relevant social media's
